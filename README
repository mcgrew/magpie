Installation

  Dependencies
    Magpie has a few dependencies. Magpie requires Python 3.x. Python 2.x is no 
    longer supported. 

    Pycrypto is required. On linux this is likely contained in your package 
    manager. On Windows and Mac OSX, this can be installed with Python's 
    pip package manager:

    python3 -m pip install pycrypto

    On Windows and Mac OSX, no other dependencies are necessary, as magpie will 
    use clip.exe on Windows/WSL and pbcopy on Mac OSX to access the clipboard.
    On Linux you will need a seperate application for clipboard access. Both
    xsel and xclip are supported.

    Magpie is also supported in Termux for Android. You will need to install 
    Python 3, pycrypto, and the Termux:API plugin. Magpie uses
    termux-clipboard-set and termux-clipboard-get for clipboard access

  Installing Magpie
    Installation of magpie is faily simple. On Linux and Mac OSX, simply copy
    the magpie.py script to somewhere in your path. I also recommend that you
    rename magpie.py to simply magpie. Be sure that you set the executable flag
    on the file:

    sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/magpie

Running Magpie

  On Linux and Mac OS, simply type 'magpie' followed by the necessary options.

  On Windows, things are a little more difficult. You will need to prefix the
  command with python, which is hopefully in your path: 
  python path-to-magpie/magpie <options>

  Usage

    Options:
      --version             show program's version number and exit
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -a USERNAME, --add=USERNAME
                            Add a password to the stored passwords with the
                            specified username.
      -f FILE, --file=FILE  Use FILE instead of
                            /home/mcgrew/.config/magpie/database for
                            storing/retrieving passwords.
      -g LENGTH, --generate=LENGTH
                            Generate a random password of the specified length
                            instead of prompting for one.
      -r, --remove          Remove specific password(s) from the database.
      --debug               Print debugging messages to stderr.
      --list                Print entire database to standard output with the
                            passwords masked.
      --change-password     Change the master password for the database.
      --find                Find an entry in the database and print its value with
                            the password masked.
      -e, --edit            Edit the file in the default system text editor and
                            import the result as the new database.
      -o FILE, --export=FILE
                            Export the password database to a delimited text file.
                            Keep this file secure, as it will contain all of your
                            passwords in plain text. Specify - as the filename to
                            print to stdout.
      -i FILE, --import=FILE
                            Import a password database from a delimited text file.
                            This will overwrite any passwords in your current
                            database. Specify - as the filename to read from
                            stdin.
      -s FILE, --salt=FILE  Use FILE instead of $HOME/.config/magpie/salt
                            for password salt.
      --tr=SUBS, --sub=SUBS

                            translates characters in generated passwords,
                            replacing characters before the : with the
                            corresponding character after the :.
      -p, --print           Print the password to standard output instead of
                            copying it to the clipboard.
