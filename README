Installation

  Dependencies
    Magpie has a few dependencies. Magpie requires Python 2.x. Python 3.x is not 
    supported at this time. Mac OSX and most Linux distributions have this
    installed by default. On windows, you can download the installer from 
    http://www.python.org/.
    
    Pycrypto is required. On linux this is likely contained in your package 
    manager. On Windows and Mac OSX, this can be installed with Python's 
    easy_install:

    easy_install PyCrypto

    On Windows and Mac OSX, no other dependencies are necessary, as magpie will 
    use Tk on Windows and pbcopy on Mac OSX to access the clipboard. On Linux 
    you will need a seperate application for clipboard access. I recommend xsel, 
    but xclip is also supported. In Linux these should be available in your 
    package manager.

  Installing Magpie
    Installation of magpie is faily simple. On Linux and Mac OSX, simply copy
    the magpie.py script to somewhere in your path. This can be /usr/bin on
    Linux/OSX, or /usr/local/bin on OSX. I also recommend that you rename
    magpie.py to simply magpie. Be sure that you set the executable flag on the 
    file:
    
    sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/magpie
    
    On Linux distributions which use Python 3.x as the default (i.e. Arch 
    Linux), you will need to ensure that magpie is run with Python 2.x. You may 
    do this by changing the first line of the scipt from '#!/usr/bin/env python' 
    to '#!/usr/bin/env python2'

Running Magpie

  On Linux and Mac OS, simply type 'magpie' followed by the necessary options.

  On Windows, things are a little more difficult. You will need to prefix the
  command with python, which is hopefully in your path: 
  python path-to-magpie/magpie <options>

  Usage
    magpie [options] [description|keywords]

    Options:
      --version             show program's version number and exit
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -a USERNAME, --add=USERNAME

      -f FILE, --file=FILE  Use FILE instead of /Users/mcgrew/.magpie/database 
                            for storing/retrieving passwords.
      -g LENGTH, --generate=LENGTH
                            Generate a random password of the specified length
                            instead of prompting for one.
      -r, --remove          Remove specific password(s) from the database.
      --debug               Print debugging messages to stderr.
      --list                Print entire database to standard output with the
                            passwords masked.
      --change-password     Change the master password for the database
      --find                Find an entry in the database and print its value 
                            with the password masked.
      -o FILE, --export=FILE
                            Export the password database to a delimited text 
                            file.  Keep this file secure, as it will contain all 
                            of your passwords in plain text. Specify - as the 
                            filename to print to stdout.
      -i FILE, --import=FILE
                            Import a password database from a delimited text 
                            file. This will overwrite any passwords in your 
                            current database. Specify - as the filename to read 
                            from stdin.
      -s FILE, --salt=FILE  Use FILE instead of /Users/mcgrew/.magpie/salt for
                            password salt.
      --tr=SUBS, --sub=SUBS Takes an argument in the form chars:chars and
                            translates characters in generated passwords,
                            replacing characters before the : with the
                            corresponding character after the :
      -p, --print           Print the password to standard output instead of
                            copying it to the clipboard
